<br>
<h2>Albert Einstein once said, <span style="color:darkorange">Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it</span></h1> 
<h3>We did not understand him at first, like all of his other theories! Duh! So, we went ahead and tried it ourselves. 
<h3>We asked ourselves a question - how much would our money grow if we invest <span class="highlighttext">Rs. 30k</span> every month for <span class="highlighttext">10 years</span> at an expected returns of <span class="highlighttext">10% per annum</span>? We would have invested 36 Lakhs and we would get <span class="highlighttextoutput">~Rs. 61 lakh</span> at the end! Impressive!</h3>
<h3>Then we asked - how much would our money grow in the same scenario but if we kept <span class="highlighttext">increasing the SIP amount by 10% every year</span>. We would have invested ~57 lakhs and we would get <span class="highlighttextoutput">~90 lakh</span>! Not too bad! </h3>
<h3>Now we became curious (and greedy)! We wanted to see how our money would grow for <span class="highlighttext">20 years or, let's say, 30 years</span> and what if our returns were more than just 10%, let's say, <span class="highlighttext">15% or 25%</span> (that's Warren Buffet level returns btw!)</h3>
<h3>Very tiresome to iterate again and again, right? Why don't you put these numbers in the form below and see the results in a nice graph for yourself?</h3>
<h3>Oh and we saw the numbers and, to quote Mr. Ranvijay from Roadies, <span style="color: blue">We were stunned!</span> because now we understand what Einstein meant!</h3>
<h3>Go ahead. Try for yourself.</h3>
